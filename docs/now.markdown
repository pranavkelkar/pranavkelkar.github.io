I wept everyday watching my guardians leave - from the gaps of the barred gate of my pre-primary school.

*Kindergarden days.*

I remember my grandfather taking me to kindergarten. He seated me on a gunny bag wrapped around the top tube of his bicycle. The ride was uncomfortable, but I enjoyed his company.

This is me with my grandfather. He passed away in August 2021. I really miss him.
