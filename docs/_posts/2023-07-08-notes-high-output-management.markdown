## Introduction

What is a good, solid management approach?

To have energetic, committed people sitting down together, looking at problems, and figuring out ways to solve them.

Who are middle managers?

Between the first-line supervisor on the shop floor and the chief executive officer of a company is a large group called middle managers who are the muscle and bone of every sizable organization.

Concept of know-how managers

People who may not supervise anyone directly but who even without strict organizational authority affect and influence the work of others. These know-how managers are sources of knowledge, skills, and understanding to people around them in an organization. They are specialists and experts of some sort who act like consultants to other members of the organization. The more our world becomes information and service oriented, the more importance know-how managers will acquire as members of middle management.

**As a middle manager, of any sort, you are in effect a chief executive of an organization yourself. Don't wait for the principles and the practices you find appealing or valid to be imposed from top. As a micro CEO, you can improve your own and your group's performance and productivity, whether or not the rest of the company follows suit.**

### Three basic ideas presented in this book:

1. Output oriented approach to management. That is to say, we apply some of the principles and desciplines of manufacturing to other forms of business enterprise, including most emphatically the work of managers.

2. Work of business, of a government bureaucracy, or most forms of human activity, is something not pursued by individuals but by teams. The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his supervision or influence.

3. A team will perform well only if peak performance is elicited from the individuals in it.
